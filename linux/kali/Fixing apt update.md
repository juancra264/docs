# A New Kali Linux Archive Signing Key

Bad news for Kali Linux users! In the coming day(s), apt update is going to fail for pretty much everyone out there:

Missing key 827C8569F2518CC677FECA1AED65462EC8D5E4C5, which is needed to verify signature.

Reason is, we had to roll a new signing key for the Kali repository. You need to download and install the new key manually, hereâ€™s the one-liner:

```
sudo wget https://archive.kali.org/archive-keyring.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg
```
