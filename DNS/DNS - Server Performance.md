## Key Metrics for DNS Performance Monitoring

- **DNS Resolution Time:** Resolving a websiteâ€™s domain name to its corresponding IP address takes time. Lower resolution times indicate better performance.
- **DNS Response Time:** The speed at which DNS servers respond to queries. Faster response times improve overall DNS performance.
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** Measures the time from the DNS request to the first byte of data received. It encompasses DNS resolution, server processing, and network latency.
- **Query Success Rate:** The percentage of successful DNS queries out of the total number of queries. A high success rate indicates reliability.
- **Propagation Time:** The time taken for DNS changes (e.g., updates to DNS records) to propagate across all DNS servers worldwide.
- **Cache Hit Ratio:** The proportion of DNS queries resolved using cached data. A higher cache hit ratio can significantly reduce DNS resolution times.
- **DNS Speed:** The overall speed at which DNS queries are resolved impacts the perceived speed of internet access for end users.

## Common DNS Performance Issues

- **High Latency:** Delays in DNS resolution can result from inefficient routing, overloaded DNS servers, or poor network infrastructure.
- **DNS Spoofing and Cache Poisoning:** Security threats that can corrupt DNS data, leading to incorrect or malicious redirections.
- **Server Overload:** High traffic volumes can overwhelm DNS servers, causing slow resolution times or outages.
- **Propagation Delays:** Slow propagation of DNS changes can lead to inconsistencies in DNS resolution, affecting accessibility.
- **DDoS Attacks:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) intrusions can flood DNS servers with excessive traffic, causing service disruptions.
