# AWS Secure Account

## Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
For the root user and all IAM users to add a critical layer of security beyond passwords.

## Create and use IAM users instead of the root user
The root user has full access to all AWS resources and should only be used for account-level tasks like billing or support.

## Avoid long-term credentials
Instead, use temporary credentials via IAM roles for workloads (e.g., EC2 instances, Lambda functions) and federated access for users.

## Set up AWS Budgets and billing alerts
to monitor and control costs, preventing unexpected charges from unintended resource usage.

## Enable AWS CloudTrail
for intelligent threat detection that identifies malicious activity, account compromise, and resource-level intrusions across your AWS environment. 

## Activate Amazon GuardDuty

## Secure your root user credentials
to manage multiple accounts and enforce security policies across them, such as centrally removing root user access keys from member accounts. 

## Use AWS Organization
to manage multiple accounts and enforce security policies across them, such as centrally removing root user access keys from member accounts.
